# Homework

This directory contains a couple of projects assigned during the semester.

The aim of the tasks was to practice with R with "real" data. In particular, my group was assigned to make some time series analysis about:

- GDP
- Housing Price
- Unemployment

making comparison between 3 countries: Italy, Ireland and Denmark.
